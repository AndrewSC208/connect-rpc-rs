# Prototype Project Template

# Local Deps
* node

## Stack
__Front-end__
* React, SWR, ReactRouter, Tailwind
__Back-end__
* Hasura (GraphQL), Postgres, AuthN/AuthZ(Casdoor, Casbin)?

First Post Steps:
1. CRA New App [X], Tailwind [X]
2. Setup Hasura locally using docker-compose [], Install SWR [], Query GetPages []
3. Add React Router [], Create some default pages (404, signup, login, Application Landing Page, Dashboard) and route between them []
4. Setup casdoor/casbin with the current docker-compose []
5. Integrate Auth with the router []
6. Add feature end to end (As a registered user, I would like to create a new project, so that I can begin to
   build my cool idea)
